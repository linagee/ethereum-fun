# ethereum-fun


This is my "test Ethereum genesis block .json"

It has:

- pre-sale wallets

TODO: 

- DEV wallets
- Bounties
- Whatever else was promised to the dozens and dozens of sub-things. (Olypmic blockchain mining promises, organizational promises, etc. etc.)
- "Official nonce" (without this, my entire ethereum-fun repo is kind of useless except as a thought experiment, which is the entire point. ;-) )
